\begin{theorem}
  For any Elliptic Curve $E: y^2 = f(x)$ the group $E(\mathbb{Q})$ is finitely
  generated.
\end{theorem}
Which requires results from cohomology which are beyond the
scope of this thesis \cite[Section VIII]{silvermanArithmetic} .
We shall prove the weaker version
\begin{theorem} \label{thm:mordell}
  Let $E: y^2 = f(x)$ be an Elliptic Curve. If
  $E(\mathbb{Q})$ contains a point of order 3, then
  $E(\mathbb{Q})$ is finitely generated.
\end{theorem}
