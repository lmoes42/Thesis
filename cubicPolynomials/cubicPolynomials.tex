We expect the reader to be well familiar with methods of
finding roots of quadratic polynomials.
In particular we have the famous quadratic formula.

In this section we shall discuss some similar concepts of solving
cubic polynomials. In particular this thesis will be interested
in monic polynomials $f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}$.
Firstly, we will generalise the concept of the term $b^2 - 4ac$ in
the quadratic formula to such a cubic. Namely, we are looking
for a function that takes the coefficients of a polynomial
and outputs 0 if and only if it has a double root.
